# Survey App (from Udemy by Stephen Grider)

### As of 10/07/2022

1. This app is primarily built using React.js for the UI and Node.js for the backend server
2. The root of the folder **survey-app** is the backend code while **client** directory is the code repository for the UI
3. Currently has two main routes: authRoute and paymentRoute

- authRoutes consists of the auth logic, integrated via SSO (Google) using passport.js
- paymentRoutes consists of the integration logic with Stripe to support checkouts and payments

\*This project is currently WIP and more business logics will be added
